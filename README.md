Hi, I’m Dibya.

I’m a graduate student at the University of Michigan–Flint and currently work as a **Graduate Student Research Assistant**.

I’m drawn to problems where data isn’t perfect, questions aren’t fully defined, and progress comes from iteration rather than certainty. Most of my work sits at the intersection of analysis, experimentation, and system-level thinking learning by building, testing, and refining ideas over time.

I care about understanding *why* something works, not just whether it does.

### How I approach work
- Start from real data and real constraints  
- Ask precise questions before choosing methods  
- Move from exploration → structure → interpretation  
- Document decisions and trade-offs as projects evolve

### What I’ve been working on
- **FemScope**  
  Research contribution to a cervical cancer screening system, supporting data exploration and technical analysis within an ongoing medical research project.

- **Cardiovascular data studies**  
  Exploring data-driven approaches related to hypertension using clinical datasets. The scope and direction are actively evolving as part of research work.

- **Applied prediction projects**  
  Hands-on projects involving health outcomes and housing data, focused on turning structured datasets into interpretable results.

### Tools & environments
Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Jupyter, Git
